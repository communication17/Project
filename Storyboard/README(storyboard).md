## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1:Crafting an Effective Speaker 

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based phonitics souds

In this experiment will we learn how phonemes  distinguish one word from the other and how to pronuncite the words in American English.
In 1888  the INTERNATIONAL PHONITIC ALPHABET (IPA) was invented in order to have a system in which there was a one to one coresspondanace between each sound in language and each phonetic symbol .
The term 'phoemes' refers to a unit of sound in specified language that distinguishes one word from other.
For  example words 'bill' and 'pill' can be distinguished on the basis of the phonemes /b/ and /p/ .Similarly ,words 'bed' and 'bet' are two different words because of the phonemes /d/ and /t/ .Every language has fixed number of such distinctive speech sounds of 'phonemes'.  

The objective of the experiment is to study DSB/SSB amplitude modulation and determine its modulation factor.
### 2. Story:
There  are 44 phonemes in english and these can be categorized into the "basic" code and sound of the "complex" code . 
To become efficient ,accurate and fluent readers ,children (adults) must mster  this "code" through phonics instruction ad through the developement of phonemic awareness.
